In the spirit Coopertition(TM) we are sharing our 2013 code.
We are running two versions of our c++ code: SimpleTemplate Extended and Command Based

Roborealm is used for spatial awareness 

Target_2.robo contains tracking for UA targets but no NT fixes or (x.y) center of gravity
Target_3.robo tracks RR tagets with NT fixes and (x,y) centering

Todo: Comine both files into final product
Todo: Add distance
